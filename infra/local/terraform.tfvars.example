# Local k3s Configuration
# Copy this file to terraform.tfvars and fill in your actual values
# This file is gitignored - your secrets stay local
#
# Registry Configuration:
# - CI/CD uses host IP to access registry (e.g., 192.168.1.100:5000)
# - Local deployments should use the same host IP format for consistency
# - The registry is accessed via HTTP (configured as insecure-registry in Docker)
# - Update this IP to match REGISTRY_HOST_IP in .github/workflows/deploy.yml
# REGISTRY_HOST_IP = "192.168.1.100"  # Your registry host IP
# REGISTRY_PORT = 5000                 # Registry port (default: 5000)

# Kubernetes Configuration
# For k3s, typically use the default location
kubeconfig_path = "/etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml"
# Or if you have it elsewhere:
# kubeconfig_path = "~/.kube/config"

# Project Configuration
project_name = "ni2faa-profile"
namespace    = "ni2faa-profile"

# Domain Configuration
# Your actual domain for the ingress
domain    = "your-actual-domain.com"
base_path = "/"

# Container Image
# 
# For CI/CD deployments:
# - GitHub Actions builds and pushes to local registry at {REGISTRY_HOST_IP}:5000
# - Image format: {REGISTRY_HOST_IP}:5000/{IMAGE_NAME}:{COMMIT_SHA}
# - Example: "192.168.1.100:5000/ni2faa/me:abc123def456"
#
# For local testing:
# - Use the image from your local registry (same format as CI/CD)
# - Format: "{REGISTRY_HOST_IP}:{REGISTRY_PORT}/{IMAGE_NAME}:{TAG}"
# - Or use GitHub Container Registry: "ghcr.io/ni2faa/me:latest"
# - Or use a local build: "localhost:5000/ni2faa/me:latest"
#
# Note: Use the same REGISTRY_HOST_IP as defined above
# (should match REGISTRY_HOST_IP in .github/workflows/deploy.yml)
image = "192.168.1.100:5000/ni2faa/me:latest"

# Replica Configuration
# Number of pod replicas for high availability
replicas_web = 2

# Resource Limits and Requests
# Adjust based on your Next.js application's needs
resources_web = {
  limits_cpu    = "1000m"
  limits_memory = "1Gi"
  requests_cpu    = "200m"
  requests_memory = "256Mi"
}

# Secrets
# Only add if your application needs environment variables
# Leave as empty map {} if no secrets needed
secret_data = {
  # Example (base64 encoded):
  # DATABASE_URL = base64encode("postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/db")
  # API_KEY      = base64encode("your-api-key")
